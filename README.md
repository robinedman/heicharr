=========
App created as a solution to an exercise with the goal of creating a terminal application to aid a company's HR department. Initially this app has to read employee records from a CSV file and display the company structure.

The app is written in a way that should make it easy to extend it with more HR reports, or other requirements.

To accomplish this I chose to use an in-memory sqlite database with ActiveRecord as ORM and created recursive functions that generate and display the company structure.

Installation
-------------
Clone the repo.

And then execute:

    $ bundle
